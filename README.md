# Dalton Berg's React Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my work and skills as a Software Engineering student at Arizona State University.

## Project Overview

This portfolio was built using React, and it features responsive design, dynamic components, and integration with various libraries. The website includes sections like About Me, Skills, Experience, and Contact, each designed to present information clearly and professionally.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.
- **React Icons**: For iconography.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control.
- **Other Libraries**: Various other libraries and tools as needed.

## Project Structure

- **Components**: Individual React components are stored in the `src/WebsiteComponents/` directory.
- **Styles**: CSS files for each component are stored in the `src/ComponentStyles/` directory.
- **Images**: Images used on the website are stored in the `src/ImagesForPortfolioWeb/` directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
The build is optimized for the best performance.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to GitHub Pages.\
Ensure you've configured the `homepage` field in `package.json` to point to your GitHub repository.

## Deployment

The website can be deployed to GitHub Pages using the following commands:

1. Make sure the `homepage` field in `package.json` is set to `"https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>"`
2. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the site.

## Customization and Ejecting

If you need to customize the build configuration:

- You can use `npm run eject`, but note that this is a one-way operation.
